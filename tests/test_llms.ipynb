Also add other common models not mentioned but relevant.\\n\\nI should also note that some models are algorithms (like kNN) versus frameworks (like neural networks which have various architectures). But maybe that\\'s too detailed. The user might need a straightforward list.\\n\\nPossible structure:\\n\\n1. Supervised Learning Models\\n   - Regression (Linear, Polynomial)\\n   - Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)\\n   - Ensembles: Bagging (Random Forest), Boosting (AdaBoost, GBM), Stacking\\n\\n2. Unsupervised Learning Models\\n   - Clustering (k-NN, K-Means), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)\\n\\n3. Deep Learning Models\\n   - CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.\\n\\n4. Other Models\\n   - Naive Bayes, k-NN, Gaussian Mixture Models\\n\\nWait, but kNN and Naive Bayes are mentioned in the source as not recommended for ensembles, so they should be included in the list.\\n\\nAlso, the user might confuse model types and algorithms. For example, Decision Trees can be a model, and Random Forest is an ensemble of them.\\n\\nI need to make sure the answer is clear and organized, possibly with bullet points or categories. Since the user asked for different types, structuring them into categories would help.\\n\\nCheck if there\\'s anything missing. Maybe anomaly detection models? Or specific applications like GANs? Probably not necessary for a general overview.\\n\\nAlso, mention that some models are hybrids, like neural networks using convolution layers (CNNs). And ensure that the answer includes the models talked about in the source text, like Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging (Random Forest), Stacking, and the comparison with stable models like kNN and Naive Bayes.\\n\\nSo the final answer should list these categories and models, explain each briefly, and reference the source\\'s points about ensemble methods. Avoid markdown, but in the actual answer, use headings if allowed. Since the user wants the answer in the box, just present it in a clear, structured way with bold headings if possible.\\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1762868882, model='nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1643, prompt_tokens=1556, total_tokens=3199, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nvidia')}"
