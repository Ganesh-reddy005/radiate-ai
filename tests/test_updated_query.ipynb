The teacher has already divided (labeled) the data \\ninto cats and dogs, and the machine is using these examples to learn. \\nOne by one. Dog by cat.\\nUnsupervised learning means the machine is left on its own with a \\npile of animal photos and a task to find out who\\'s who. Data is not \\nlabeled, there\\'s no teacher, the machine is trying to find any patterns \\non its own. We\\'ll talk about these methods below.\\nClearly, the machine will learn faster with a teacher, so it\\'s more \\ncommonly used in real-life tasks. There are two types of such tasks: \\nclassification – an object\\'s category prediction, and \\nregression – prediction of a specific point on a numeric \\naxis.\\nadd a comment here\\nClassification\\n\"Splits objects based at one of the attributes known beforehand. \\nSeparate socks by based on color, documents based on language, music \\nby genre\"\\nToday used for:\\n– Spam filtering\\n– Language detection\\n– A search of similar documents\\n– Sentiment analysis\\n– Recognition of handwritten characters and numbers\\n– Fraud detection\\nPopular algorithms: Naive Bayes , Decision Tree , Logistic Regression , \\nK-Nearest Neighbours , Support Vector Machine\\nFrom here onward you can comment with additional information for \\nthese sections. Feel free to write your examples of tasks. Everything \\nis written here based on my own subjective experience.\\nadd a comment here\\nRegression is basically classification where we forecast a number \\ninstead of category. Examples are car price by its mileage, traffic by \\ntime of the day, demand volume by growth of the company etc. \\nRegression is perfect when something depends on time.\\nEveryone who works with finance and analysis loves regression. It\\'s \\neven built-in to Excel. And it\\'s super smooth inside — the machine \\nsimply tries to draw a line that indicates average correlation.

Everyone is talking about \\nit, a few know what to do, and only your teacher is doing it. If you \\never tried to read articles about machine learning on the Internet, vas3k.commost likely you stumbled upon two types of them: thick academic \\ntrilogies filled with theorems (I couldn’t even get through half of one) \\nor fishy fairytales about artificial intelligence , data-science magic , and \\njobs of the future .\\nI decided to write a post I’ve been wishing existed for a long time. A \\nsimple introduction for those who always wanted to understand \\nmachine learning. Only real-world problems, practical solutions, \\nsimple language, and no high-level theorems. One and for everyone. \\nWhether you are a programmer or a manager.\\nLet\\'s roll.\\nadd a comment here\\nThe map of the machine learning \\nworld\\nPart 1. Classical Machine Learning\\nThe first methods came from pure statistics in the \\'50s. They solved \\nformal math tasks — searching for patterns in numbers, evaluating \\nthe proximity of data points, and calculating vectors\\' directions.\\nNowadays, half of the Internet is working on these algorithms. When \\nyou see a list of articles to \"read next\" or your bank blocks your card at random gas station in the middle of nowhere, most likely it\\'s the \\nwork of one of those little guys.\\nBig tech companies are huge fans of neural networks. Obviously. For \\nthem, 2% accuracy is an additional 2 billion in revenue. But when you \\nare small, it doesn\\'t make sense. I heard stories of the teams spending \\na year on a new recommendation algorithm for their e-commerce \\nwebsite, before discovering that 99% of traffic came from search \\nengines. Their algorithms were useless. Most users didn\\'t even open \\nthe main page.\\nDespite the popularity, classical approaches are so natural that you \\ncould easily explain them to a toddler. They are like basic arithmetic \\n— we use it every day, without even thinking.\\n[collapse all] [show all] 2 comments \\n1.1 Supervised Learning\\nClassical machine learning is often divided into two categories – \\nSupervised  and Unsupervised Learning .In the first case, the machine has a \"supervisor\" or a \"teacher\" who \\ngives the machine all the answers, like whether\\n\\n[Source: /Users/ganeshreddybodireddy/Desktop/radiate-ai/test_data/ml-book.pdf, Chunk 2, Rerank: 0.3376]\\n machine does so with \\nmathematical accuracy, calculating the average interval to every dot.\\nWhen the line is straight — it\\'s a linear regression, when it\\'s curved – \\npolynomial. These are two major types of regression. The other ones \\nare more exotic. Logistic regression is a black sheep in the flock. \\nDon\\'t let it trick you, as it\\'s a classification method, not regression.\\nIt\\'s okay to mess with regression and classification, though. Many \\nclassifiers turn into regression after some tuning. We can not only \\ndefine the class of the object but memorize how close it is. Here \\ncomes a regression.\\nIf you want to get deeper into this, check these series: Machine \\nLearning for Humans . I really love and recommend it!\\nadd a comment here1.2 Unsupervised learning\\nUnsupervised was invented a bit later, in the \\'90s. It is used less \\noften, but sometimes we simply have no choice.\\nLabeled data is luxury. But what if I want to create, let\\'s say, a bus \\nclassifier? Should I manually take photos of million fucking buses on \\nthe streets and label each of them? No way, that will take a lifetime, \\nand I still have so many games not played on my Steam account.\\nThere\\'s a little hope for capitalism in this case. Thanks to social \\nstratification, we have millions of cheap workers and services like \\nMechanical Turk  who are ready to complete your task for $0.05. And \\nthat\\'s how things usually get done here.\\nOr you can try to use unsupervised learning. But I can\\'t remember \\nany good practical application for it, though. It\\'s usually useful for \\nexploratory data analysis  but not as the main algorithm. Specially \\ntrained meatbag with Oxford degree feeds the machine with a ton of \\ngarbage and watches it.
